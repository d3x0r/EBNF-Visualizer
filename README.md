# EBNF Visualizer (JS Version)

Original project http://dotnet.jku.at/applications/Visualizer
Written in C#.

# Live Version

[Live Demo](https://d3x0r.github.io/EBNF-Visualizer)

# Notes

Ported to JS almost directly from C# by hand.

Supports pasting a BNF file and getting a visualization. It is rendered into a canvas which can be copied.  Probable extension for rending to SVG is probably on the table.
